# hack-four

This is a variation on Connect 4 where gravity can act in any cardinal direction (toggled by the magnets on the sides of the screen). The concept was part of a project I worked on for HackRice 2018. We didn't finish but I wanted to see it through here.

I tried to make a standalone executable, but py2app is a nightmare, so to play this game you'll either have to install pygame or you'll have to just have to watch the [demo](https://youtu.be/4UytITUvdHo):

## Running
This project is built with pygame, so you must have that installed. To run the game, execute the main.py file. You can also play a [lesser version](http://gravityconnect4.surge.sh/) that I made for a web dev class (I think for honor code reasons, I cannot put the source for that project on Github, but \*wink wink\* you can always go to that link and view the page source).
